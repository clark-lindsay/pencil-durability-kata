# pencil-durability-kata
A code kata for practicing TDD and clean coding principles.\

Running this code does require node to be installed, but if you are running it on a Mac with Homebrew installed, then the "make mac-install" command will dispatch Homebrew to handle the node installation for you. Otherwise, node has very straigthforward documentation for downloading:\
    https://nodejs.org/en/download/ \
And if you are a Mac user that does not have Homebrew, I would highly reccomend it! Find it at:\
    https://brew.sh \

Installing node on a Mac with Homebrew installed:\
Run the following terminal command in the project folder:\
    $ make mac-install \

The following commands assume a Unix environment (Mac or Linux), but should also work in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\

To run the tests:\
    $ make test \

And to run a node Read-Eval-Print-Loop with the Pencil class already in context: \
    $ make build \
    $ make repl \
